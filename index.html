      <h2>Stage 1: Problem Statement</h2>
      <p>This stage focuses on the nervous system, specifically spinal cord injuries (SCI). These injuries disrupt neural communication between the brain and the body, potentially causing temporary or permanent mobility loss.</p>
      <p>SCIs can be caused by car accidents, falls, or tumors. They are classified as complete or incomplete depending on the damage. Common symptoms include paralysis, spasticity, and muscle atrophy, significantly affecting quality of life.</p>
      <p>Rehabilitation is essential. We propose using exoskeletons as a tool to promote neuroplasticity and help recover motor functions, aiming to greatly improve the daily lives of patients.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="stage2">
      <h2>Stage 2: Environment Design</h2>
      <p>As a solution, we propose using exoskeletons to support rehabilitation for individuals with SCI. This technology can enhance neuroplasticity and reduce complications related to these injuries.</p>
      <p>Our goal is to improve patients' quality of life through rehabilitation and assistance in daily tasks. We hypothesize that, although still in development, exoskeletons have the potential to restore mobility and revolutionize modern medicine.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="stage3">
      <h2>Stage 3: Programming with Sensors</h2>
      <p>To aid in learning about human body systems, we developed an educational robot. Using Arduino technology, sensors, and motors, the robot interacts with a body model.</p>
      <p>It moves over a diagram, highlighting different systems with lights and sounds, offering students an engaging and interactive experience.</p>
      <p>This technological tool combines science, education, and creativity to enhance biological understanding through a more hands-on and appealing approach.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="conclusion">
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>In this project, we addressed a real issue—spinal cord injuries—and proposed a technological solution using exoskeletons. We also developed an educational prototype that facilitates learning about human body systems.</p>
      <p>In Stage 1, we explored the severity of SCIs. In Stage 2, we presented an innovative proposal based on medical robotics. And in Stage 3, we created a practical educational tool that merges robotics with biology.</p>
      <p>This work demonstrates how technology can transform both education and healthcare, improving learning and patients' quality of life.</p>

    <section id="future">
      <h2>Future of Transportation: Autonomous Vehicles</h2>
      <p>The advancement of transportation technology continues to push the boundaries of innovation, with autonomous vehicles emerging as a key development in the quest for safer and more efficient mobility. This prototype represents a significant step toward reducing traffic accidents caused by human error, enhancing road safety, and optimizing urban transportation systems. By utilizing advanced artificial intelligence, sensors, and real-time data processing, autonomous vehicles are designed to navigate complex environments with precision, reacting to obstacles and traffic conditions faster than human drivers.</p>
      <p>The adoption of autonomous vehicles is steadily increasing across different regions, driven by the potential benefits they offer, including reduced congestion, lower emissions, and improved accessibility for individuals who may have limitations preventing them from driving. As this technology continues to evolve, we stand at the threshold of a transportation revolution that could redefine the way people commute, interact with their surroundings, and experience mobility in their daily lives. With continuous improvements and integration into modern infrastructure, autonomous vehicles pave the way for a future where transportation is smarter, safer, and more sustainable.</p>
